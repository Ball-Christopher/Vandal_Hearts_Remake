# Vandal_Hearts_Remake

Please see the Wiki for more information.

This project aims to recreate Vandal Hearts, a PlayStation game from 1995, using Python and Cocos2D.  The 
current version implements the first stage in Fire Emblem style top-down graphics.  The first version of the AI is functional, so you can play through a significantly easier version of the first stage.

Next step is to implement Chapter 4, Stage 1 in a similar way.
